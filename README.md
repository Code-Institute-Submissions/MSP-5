#### Goal

This project is my fourth milestone project for Code Institute, and itâ€™s the Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project.
A Online E-commerce Store designed for the fictitious company named "Tech Buddy."
The aim of the project, according to the project guidelines, was to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
This project will demonstrate what I have learned in the course from frontend, backend and full stack web development with stripe payments.
